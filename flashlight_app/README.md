# flashlight_app

Develop a flashlight app that turns on the device's flashlight when the app is
launched and turns it off when the app is closed.

1. UI Design: Create a single screen layout with a toggle button to control the
flashlight.

2. Flashlight Functionality: Check for the availability of a camera flash on the
device. Implement code to turn on and off the flashlight based on the user's
input.

3. App Lifecycle: Handle the app's lifecycle events to ensure the flashlight is turned off when the app is closed or paused.

4. Error Handling: Implement error handling to handle scenarios where the device
doesn't have a camera flash or if the flashlight fails to turn on.
